This repository contains an implementation of several graph algorithms on the
Apache Spark GraphX platform in scala language.

It will implement the following algorithms:
1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Cycle detection
4. Triangle counting
5. Shortest path finding

The algorithms will be implemented using the message-passing API and the pregel API available in Spark GraphX.

The code has been tested in scala version 2.12 and Apache Spark versions 3.2x, 3.3x and 3.4
