This repository contains an implementation of several graph algorithms on the
Apache Spark GraphX platform in scala language.

The following algorithms have been implemented:
1. Shortest path finding
2. Triangle counting
3. Degree counting

The algorithms will be implemented using either the GraphX message-passing API or
the pregel API available in Spark GraphX.
The method will be chosen based on the algorithm's performance on large graphs.

The code has been tested in scala version 2.12 and 2.13 with Apache Spark versions 3.2x, 3.3x and 3.4
